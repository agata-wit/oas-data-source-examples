## Running mock REST APIs locally

There's a great open-source project that allows you to run mock REST APIs locally on your machine. You can find it [here](https://github.com/typicode/json-server). Once you install it, use the db.json file attached to each example to spin up a mock API, which correlates with the rest of the example files.
